An alternative design I could've done is had Door also be an extension of Item because it has most of the same function, but I thought the name of the variable "isFound" would be too confusing to use in the context of the door, so I chose to rewrite some of the same methods and attributes that I had in Item in Door because I wanted to name Door's boolean attribute "isOpen," which was clearer to me and hopefully to others reading my code. It also just made more sense to me from an object-oriented thinking standpoint because all of the other things that I made that were subclasses of Item were things that you pick up and put in your inventory.
