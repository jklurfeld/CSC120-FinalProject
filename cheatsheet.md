This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

The goal of the game is to find all four of your kittens, Mittens, Fluffy, Scruffy, and Boots. You start by walking around the map to find them and to pick up objects that help you find them. 

The available commands are:

+ grab <object> that you come across
+ use <item> that you have picked up and is in your inventory
+ open <name of thing to be opened>
+ print inventory for a list of Kittens and items that you have already picked up

Challenges to overcome in the game:
+ There is a box at (1,3) that you have to use the open command to open in order to find Fluffy
+ There is a red fridge door at (3,0), and in order to open it you have to find the red key at (3,3) and say "use red key" while you're at the door to open it and grab Scruffy inside
+ There is a bed at (3,2) which Boots is under, and in order to find and grab boots you have to find and grab the flashlight at (0,2) and then "use flashlight" when you're at the bed
